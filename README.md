# Horiseon-Facelift

Welcome to my first project entitled "On The Horiseon: Branding Your Business". The unique name I gave my site is
  "On the Horiseon: Brand Your Business." My repository that I created for this project is entited "Horiseon-Facelift".

In full transparency, I was so lost trying to unpack this project in its original HTML and CSS file versions. The original files were
so non-descript and hard to decipher the unique elements. If the original HTML had a voice, it would be monotone and without inflection.
Not to mention, the class and IDs were tricky to follow in the CSS and see which elements were impacted.
  
  Every time that I made a change in the HTML or CSS, it impacted something else and I found myself stuggling to find the "root" within 
  the <div> soup, and it was hard to track the CSS elements with the way everything was displayed in the CSS. 
  
And because I am a complete newbie to this whole thing, I decided to just rebuild the entire website. I rebuilt the entire HTML and
created, then linked it with an entirely new CSS file. (Go, Yani!!!) Once I was done, I used the nomenclature that I saw in the
02-Challenge folder in our class repository to keep it streamlined. 
  
It may have been extra to rebuild this entire website but I'm so glad I did because I really developed a super conceptual understanding 
(for myself) on how these things work together.
  
What I'm proud of is that I used appropriate and clear HTML tags that made sense with the element on the website so the HTML is super 
logical with the progression of the website from top to bottom. Like I mentioned above, part of the consternation that I was feeling 
also came from the CSS file because I couldn't follow the attributes so when I rebuilt the page, I used class and ID attributes that I 
could follow - that was also sequential with the HTML file. (My class and ID attributes are unique and I love them!) The indentations
 are on point. There are accessible alt attributes. My HTML code is BOMB to me! I'm so happy with it.
  
While I am proud of the outcome, a growth area for me is still "code organization". I rewrote the HTML file in a readable way but as I 
was working with my tutor, I learned that my HTML can be more organized so that is what I'm going to continue to work on. What you will 
see in my code is a preference to keep everything all on the same line because it helps me to locate the attributes, image sources, text, 
titles, etc. But I'm not sure if this approach to organization is right or efficient or best practice so I'm excited to grow in this
area. 
  
Onto the good stuff:
  
The URL of the deployed application is https://yaniscript.github.io/Horiseon-Facelift/

The URL of my GitHub repository that contains the code is 
https://github.com/YaniScript/Horiseon-Facelift.git

My repository for this challenge is called “Horiseon-Facelift” but I truly feel like I made this HTML better. I gave the HTML a “facelift”
- if you will.

Once you are in the repository, the HTML file is entitled index.html and the CSS stylesheet is in the “assets/css” folder entitled style.css.

I hope you enjoy how I improved the HTML, and that you are able to follow the elements structure with how they are laid out on the actual website.
